I studied Civil Engineering at Universidad de los Andes, Colombia (1999-2003). After a brief period of work in industry as Civil and Geotechnical Engineer, I 
completed the MSc in Soil Mechanics and Engineering Seismology (2005), and my PhD in Soil Mechanics (2010), both at Imperial College London. I have then worked 
at Edinburgh Napier University since 2009. You can also have a look at my [instutional website](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/daniel-barreto-gonzalez) for 
further details about academic activity.

Whilst working at a teaching-focused university, I am very active in research. My research focuses on the Discrete Element Method (DEM). I am interested on 
particle shape and particle size distribution (PSD) effects on soil behaviour, as well as anything else related to DEM, including contact model development, 
validation, calibration procedures, etc. PhD and Post-doc candidates on these topics are welcome to contact me. You can also get involved with me and a 
fantastic team of DEM researchers via the [Open Network on DEM Simulations (ON-DEM)](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA22132/). 

I am also prolific (award winning) peer reviewer who has been Editorial Panel Member for journals such as GÃ©otechnique, Computers and Geotechnics, ICE 
Proceedings - Geotechnical Engineering, amongst others. I was contributing author for the textbook "Geotechnical Engineering Design" published by Wiley in 2015. Also 
UK (nominated) member for the technical committee TC105 (Geomechanics micro to macro) of the International Society of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical 
Engineering, and Emeritus Member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Young Academy of Scotland.
