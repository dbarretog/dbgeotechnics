  title={Rubber-soil mixtures: use of grading entropy theory to evaluate stiffness and liquefaction susceptibility},
  author={Bernal-Sanchez, Juan and Leak, James and Barreto, Daniel},
  abstract={Rubber-soil mixtures are known to have mechanical properties that enable their use in backfills, road construction or geotechnical seismic isolation systems. The complexity of these mixtures comes from adding soft (i.e. rubber) particles that increases the number of particle properties to consider when studying the macroscopic behaviour. The distinction between sand-like and rubber-like behaviour is normally presented in relation to the rubber content and size ratio between particles. It is however unknown how the change on the mixture gradation affects the mechanical behaviour of RSm. Entropy coordinates condense the entire particle size distribution (PSD) to a single point on a Cartesian plane, accounting for all the information in the gradation. Grading entropy coordinates have been used to study typical geotechnical behaviours of mostly incompressible (i.e. sand) soils. In this study, entropy coordinates are used to analyse the correlation between the small-strain stiffness and liquefaction susceptibility of RSm and their PSDs. The results suggest that entropy coordinates can be used effectively on RSm as an alternative means of assessment of typical soil behaviours, being also able to distinguish between sand-like and rubber-like behaviours. Based on the 30 PSDs analysed, it is also evidenced that internal stability criterion proposed by Lőrincz (1986) can be used to predict the liquefaction susceptibility of RSm. The normalised base entropy (A) has also been shown to increase with the rubber content, which is linked to a lower liquefaction susceptibility, due to the supporting effect of rubber particles on strong-force chains formed of sand particles.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
