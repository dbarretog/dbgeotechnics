  abstract = {This paper reviews commonly used parameters and prediction models for assessing the permeability of granular soils. Following 
    a review of published models for prediction of soil permeability, a dimensional homogenous transformation model for a-priori estimation 
    of soil permeability was calibrated using a large database (CG/KSAT/7/1278) comprising permeability data for a wide range of granular 
    soils sourced from over 50 publications. The new transformation model requires knowledge of the void ratio and gradation of the material 
    to make estimates of the soil permeability. The prediction accuracy of the calibrated model was then assessed alongside that of other 
    empirical and semi-empirical models also calibrated using CG/KSAT/7/1278. The potential influences of void ratio, key gradation parameters 
    and permeability test type on the prediction accuracy of the proposed model are also examined. The paper shows that while the fitted 
    constants in the proposed transformation model are affected to varying extents by the aforementioned parameters, it does offer reasonable 
    predictions of permeability with only knowledge of the void ratio and material gradation required.},

	abstract = {In the ongoing research, an approximate, grading entropy based, advanced interpolation method is applied to establish empirical 
	  functions between the grading curves and the model parameters of sands. The space of the grain size distribution curves with N fractions 
	  is isomorphic to the space of the unit-sided simplex with dimension N-1. The traditional interpolation over the simplex with dimension N-1 
	  is problematic since the number of the sub-simplexes (and the interpolation points) may increase exponentially with N. To overcome this 
	  difficulty, the function is approximately interpolated, which means that the interpolation is made on some 2-dimensional sections of the simplex and is extended to the whole simplex, using the grading entropy map. Two kinds of 2-dimensional sections can be used based on either fractal distributions or partly fractal partly on some maximal gap-graded distributions. In this paper the experiments were made on the artificial mixtures of natural sand grains earlier. Two kinds of functions were approximately interpolated for the minimum dry density using the measured data. One kind of function was determined for the parameters of an SWCC model directly from the level lines previously graphically interpolated from fractal distribution data.},

  title={Rubber-soil mixtures: use of grading entropy theory to evaluate stiffness and liquefaction susceptibility},
  author={Bernal-Sanchez, Juan and Leak, James and Barreto, Daniel},
  abstract={Rubber-soil mixtures are known to have mechanical properties that enable their use in backfills, road construction 
   or geotechnical seismic isolation systems. The complexity of these mixtures comes from adding soft (i.e. rubber) particles that 
   increases the number of particle properties to consider when studying the macroscopic behaviour. The distinction between sand-like 
   and rubber-like behaviour is normally presented in relation to the rubber content and size ratio between particles. It is however 
   unknown how the change on the mixture gradation affects the mechanical behaviour of RSm. Entropy coordinates condense the entire 
   particle size distribution (PSD) to a single point on a Cartesian plane, accounting for all the information in the gradation. Grading 
   entropy coordinates have been used to study typical geotechnical behaviours of mostly incompressible (i.e. sand) soils. In this study, 
   entropy coordinates are used to analyse the correlation between the small-strain stiffness and liquefaction susceptibility of RSm and 
   their PSDs. The results suggest that entropy coordinates can be used effectively on RSm as an alternative means of assessment of 
   typical soil behaviours, being also able to distinguish between sand-like and rubber-like behaviours. Based on the 30 PSDs analysed, 
   it is also evidenced that internal stability criterion proposed by Lőrincz (1986) can be used to predict the liquefaction 
   susceptibility of RSm. The normalised base entropy (A) has also been shown to increase with the rubber content, which is linked to 
   a lower liquefaction susceptibility, due to the supporting effect of rubber particles on strong-force chains formed of sand particles.},

  abstract = {Particle breakage in soils is a well-recognised behaviour. Conventional methods for quantifying the breakage process rely 
    on calculating the area between the particle size distribution (PSD) curves produced before and after crushing. A key aspect of 
	breakage is understanding the process across the different size/sieve fractions. Grading entropy coordinates allow for the 
	representation of any PSD to be shown as a single point on a Cartesian plane and are able to track grading evolution with relative 
	ease. In this study, grading entropy coordinates are compared to three commonly used breakage indices (Br, Br* and IG). It is shown 
	that grading entropy coordinates are advantageous over the traditional indices in quantifying subtle changes in the PSD evolution 
	and directly provide further insight with regards to the individual fraction sizes. It is also discussed that conventional breakage 
	indices rely on relative measures and are dependent on assumptions of an initial and/or final PSD. In contrast, grading entropy 
	coordinates depend only on the characteristics of the (current) PSD curve. It was also observed that the breakage evolution captured 
	by the entropy coordinates is able to determine the rate at which differently sized particles break as differently sized particles 
	take on stress. Moreover, it is suggested that entropy coordinates may also stress path dependency, a feature not present in 
	conventional indices.},

	bibtex_show={true},
	abstract = {A Geotechnical Seismic Isolation (GSI) system is proposed in this study based on the use of Rubber-Soil mixtures (RSm) 
	  to facilitate the benefits of dynamic soil-foundation structure interaction. The latter is possible due to the lower stiffness 
	  and greater capacity to dissipate energy of RSm. However, the research done on RSm has been limited to the element scale context. 
	  In this study, the dynamic response of a modified soil foundation has been investigated by adding soft zones comprising RSm. A 
	  1g shaking table was used to apply a sequence of sinusoidal excitations to a soil-lumped mass system. The results have shown 
	  that the rubber addition results in a reduction of the amplification at frequencies higher than the system natural frequency. 
	  This change in the dynamic response is due to the shift in the natural frequency and the dampening of the peak output accelerations. 
	  This study shows thus that an alternative design consideration with bagged soft zones, adjacent to the soil foundation, can offset 
	  the incoming disturbances and hence could protect both new and existing constructions.},

These systems operate independently and interplay harmoniously via important networked structures over multiple spatial and temporal scales. This paper presents arguments and derivations couched by the authors, to first give a better understanding of these intertwined networked structures, and then to give an insight of why and how these can be imitated to develop a new generation of nature-symbiotic ground engineering techniques. The paper draws on numerous recent advances made by the authors, and others, in imitating forms (e.g. synthetic fibres that imitate plant roots), materials (e.g. living composite materials, or living soil that imitate fungi and microbes), generative processes (e.g. managed decomposition of construction rubble to mimic weathering of aragonites to calcites), and functions (e.g. recreating the self-healing, self-producing, and self-forming capacity of natural systems). Advances are reported in three categories of Materials, Models, and Methods (3Ms). A novel value-based appraisal tool is also presented, providing a means to vet the effectiveness of 3Ms as standalone units or in combinations.},

	title = {Examination of saturated hydraulic conductivity using grading curve functions},
	abstract = { In a previous research program 74 artificial soil mixtures of natural fluvial soils were prepared in 4 series of measurements for falling 
	head permeability testing, differing in d10. The conclusions drawn from the original investigations were as follows: the k showed a decreasing 
	tendency with the increase of the uniformity index U for each series of measurements and increasing tendency with d10. In this research these are 
	used (i) to test the value of the grading entropy parameters in case of non-precise grading curve measurement with missing fines, (ii) to correlate the 
	usual grading curve parameters like d10, d30, d5 and d60 or their ratios and the grading entropy parameters, (iii) to validate some 
	existing permeability – grading curve equations and to elaborate some new permeability – grading curve relationships partly with entropy parameters partly 
	with the usual parameters. For these aims, series I to IV have been started to be reevaluated, some specific surface formulae were derived. Some additional,
	literature data were also considered. The very first results are presented here. According to the results, the fine fractions significantly influenced the 
	value of the entropy parameters. The base entropy So showed strong relationship with and parameters like d10, d30, d5 and d60. The 
	entropy increment $\Delta$ S showed a monotonic increasing relationship with U. The specific surface parameter (containing density info) showed the best 
	relationship with k out of the d-type parameters like d10 or harmonic mean dh. The original conclusions were reformulated in terms of S0 and 
	$\Delta$ S. It was also concluded that those parameters that are based on all measured data are more precise than the single diameter values in the 
	k-regressions. The specific surface parameter is the best in this repect probably since containing density information, too. },

	  -Compare, existing and innovative options for foundation design on peat, so as to lessen the magnitude of the construction challenge.

	abstract = {The  measured  grading  curve  is  an empirical  distribution  function, a  step  function. This  is  considered  here  as  a  discrete  
	  distribution  with  fixed  statistical  cells.  In  the  grading entropy  theory  it  is  characterized  by  the  relative  entropy  resulting  in  
	  two sets  of  entropy coordinates.  These  first  and  second  grading  entropy  coordinates  classify  well  the  grading curves  and  are  
	  statistically  more  soundly  based  in  terms  of  information  content  than  the approximate  quantile  type  parameters  used  at  present.  In  
	  the theoretical  and  experimental work on the grading entropy coordinates, the physical content of the parameters are analysed. The  results  can  
	  be  summarized  as  follows. The  first  entropy  parameter  seems  to  be  a continuous internal stability measure. The second one allows the 
	  definition of a unique, mean grading  curve  with  finite  fractal  grain  size  distribution  for  fixed  value  of the  first parameter. The first 
	  parameter is related to internal structure, proven here by DEM tools. It is shown by Math tools that the probability of a stable state of the grading 
	  entropy theory is very low. The generally  occurring  stable  states  in  the  nature  are  originated  from  the  degradation  which  is deterministic. 
	  The  internal  stability  of  the  engineering  structures  can  be  characterized  by grading entropy.},

The concerning compaction are presented in terms of grading curves. The entropy coordinates were computed for the grading curves, before and after compaction. According to the results, the base entropy So, which is a kind of dimensionless mean log diameter, is decreasing during compaction, the entropy increment is increasing according to the entropy principle.

	abstract = {This paper presents an investigation into the effects of particle-size distribution on the critical state behavior of granular materials using 
	  Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations on both spherical and non-spherical particle assemblies. A series of triaxial test DEM simulations examine the 
	  influence of particle-size distribution (PSD) and particle shape, which were independently assessed in the analyses presented. Samples were composed of 
	  particles with varying shapes characterized by overall regularity (OR) and different PSDs. The samples were subjected to the axial compression through 
	  different loading schemes: constant volume, constant mean effective stress, and constant lateral stress. All samples were sheared to large strains to 
	  ensure that a critical state was reached. Both the macroscopic and microscopic behaviors in these tests are discussed here within the framework of the 
	  anisotropic critical state theory (ACST). It is shown that both OR and PSD may affect the response of the granular assemblies in terms of the 
	  stress-strain relations, dilatancy, and critical state behaviors. For a given PSD, both the shear strength and fabric norm decrease with an increase 
	  in OR. The critical state angle of shearing resistance is highly dependent on particle shape. In terms of PSD, uniformly distributed assemblies mobilize 
	  higher shear strength and experience more dilative responses than specimens with a greater variation of particle sizes. The position of the critical state 
	  line in the e-p’ space is also affected by PSD. However, the effects of PSD on critical strength and evolution of fabric are negligible. These findings 
	  highlight the importance of particle shape and PSD that should be included in the development of constitutive models for granular materials.},

	title = {The influence of particle geometry and the intermediate stress ratio on the shear behavior of granular materials},
	abstract = {The behavior of granular materials is very complex in nature and depends on particle shape, stress path, fabric, density, particle size distribution, amongst others. This paper presents a study of the effect of particle geometry (aspect ratio) on the mechanical behaviour of granular materials using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). This study discusses 3D DEM simulations of conventional triaxial and true triaxial tests. The numerical experiments employ samples with different particle aspect ratios and a unique particle size distribution (PSD). Test results show that both particle aspect ratio (AR) and intermediate stress ratio (b=(σ2'-σ3')/(σ1'-σ3')) affect the macro-and micro-scale responses. At the macro-scale, the shear strength decreases with an increase in both aspect ratio and intermediate stress ratio b values. At the micro-scale level, the fabric evolution is also affected by both AR and b. The results from DEM analyses qualitatively agree with available experimental data. The critical state behaviour and failure states are also discussed. It is observed that the position of the critical state loci in the compression (e-p') space is only slightly affected by aspect ratio (AR) while the critical stress ratio is dependent on both AR and b. It is also demonstrated that the influence of the aspect ratio and the intermediate stress can be captured by micro-scale fabric evolutions that can be well understood within the framework of existing critical state theories. It is also found that for a given stress path, a unique critical state fabric norm is dependent on the particle shape but is independent of critical state void ratio.},

	title = {The Influence of Particles’ Aspect Ratio on the Shear Behaviour of Granular Materials},
	abstract = {The mechanical response of granular material depends both on the material properties (e.g. stiffness, anisotropy, permeability, etc.) and particle geometry (shape, roughness, etc.). This paper presents a study of the effect of particle shape (i.e. aspect ratio) on the mechanical behaviour of a granular assembly using DEM (discrete element method). In this study, the numerical simulations employ samples with different particle aspect ratios but identical particle size distribution (PSD). Conventional triaxial compression DEM simulations are carried out under both ‘drained’ and ‘undrained’ (constant volume) conditions. The shear behaviour of the assemblies and the evolution of their microstructure under shearing are examined in detail. At the macroscopic level, the test results show that the particle aspect ratio has a significant effect on the stress-strain curve, peak strength, dilatancy characteristics and critical state behaviour. In particular, the samples with lower aspect ratios can lead to higher peak/residual shear strengths, and higher angles of shearing resistance. The critical state occurs at a higher position in a void ratio versus mean normal stress plot for lowest particle aspect ratio. The results from numerical analysis compare reasonably well with the available experimental data. At the microscopic level, the fabric evolution is greatly affected by the aspect ratio, and the critical state fabric is also examined.},

	abstract = {Geotechnical centrifuge modelling provides an opportunity to examine novel and complex events in a well-controlled and repeatable environment. While grain interaction and contact dynamics are considered in centrifuge modelling, the soil is treated as a continuum, consistent with standard geotechnical analysis. In the last four decades, particle size effects have been normally approached by the ratio of median particle diameter to critical dimension of modelled structure. The current study considers the response of a granular medium in a centrifuge model by coupling physical tests and equivalent discrete element simulations. The response of a strip footing on uniformly graded glass ballotini is investigated. This is chosen as the sample characteristics can be accurately replicated in a discrete element simulation. Particle size distribution, gravity and footing width are scaled in the context of model-the-model technique and the sensitivity of the bulk response to rapid increase in stress level is explored. This will help establishing the link between the micro phenomena and the macro response and contribute towards improving geotechnical design. The paper describes the work conducted to overcome challenges related to physical modelling including particle mixing, sample preparation, image analysis, and loading apparatus.},

	abstract = {There is no agreement between experimental researchers whether the point where a granular material responds with a large change of stresses, 
	  strains or excess pore water pressure given a prescribed small input of some of the same variables defines a straight line or a curve in the stress space. 
	  This line, known as the instability line, may also vary in shape and position if the onset of instability is measured from drained or undrained triaxial 
	  tests. Failure of granular materials, which might be preceded by the onset of instability, is a subject that the geotechnical engineers have to deal with 
	  in the daily practice, and generally speaking it is associated to different phenomena observed not only in laboratory tests but also in the field. 
	  Examples of this are the liquefaction of loose sands subjected to undrained loading conditions and the diffuse instability under drained loading 
	  conditions. This research presents results of DEM simulations of undrained triaxial tests with the aim of studying the influence of stress history and 
	  relative density on the onset of instability in granular materials. Micro-mechanical analysis including the evolution of coordination numbers and fabric 
	  tensors is performed aiming to gain further insight on the particle-scale interactions that underlie the occurrence of this instability. In addition to 
	  provide a greater understanding, the results presented here may be useful as input for macro-scale constitutive models that enable the prediction of the

	title = {Use of DEM and elastic stability analysis to explain the influence of the intermediate principal stress on shear strength},
	abstract = {One interesting aspect of soil response is the sensitivity of the mechanical behaviour to the intermediate principal stress. In this study, a 
	  fundamental mechanism that explains the influence of the intermediate stress ratio (b) on soil shear strength is proposed. Prior experimental, numerical 
	  and analytical studies have indicated that soil failure occurs when the strong force chains that transmit stress through the material buckle. These strong 
	  force chains are networks of contacting particles that are relatively highly stressed, and aligned in the direction of the major principal stress 
	  ( σ ′ 1 ). The buckling resistance is thought to be determined by ‘weaker' lateral networks of less-stressed contacting particles that are orthogonal 
	  to the strong force chain orientation. Discrete-element method (DEM) simulations of true triaxial tests show that as b is varied, so too is the relative 
	  support provided by the force chains orientated in the directions of the intermediate and minor principal stresses ( σ ′ 2 and σ ′ 3 respectively). At a 
	  macro scale, the effective axial stiffnesses along these directions vary. The DEM dataset is complex, and so a conceptually simple model is used to assess 
	  the influence of lateral support on the buckling resistance of a single column of connected nodes, analogous to a single force chain. The lateral support 
	  is modelled using linear springs. When the stiffnesses of these springs are selected to reflect the variation in axial stiffness with b observed in the 
	  DEM simulations, the reduction in axial buckling load with b is found to be similar to the reduction in major principal stress with b. When combined, the 
	  DEM data and simple analytical model support a hypothesis that failure under three-dimensional stress conditions is determined by buckling of the strong 
	  force chains. It is the variation in lateral support provided by the force network aligned along the minor and intermediate stress directions that 
	  determines, in part at least, the relation between soil shear strength and b. The data presented provide a conceptually simple framework to justify the 
	  need to consider three-dimensional effects in geomechanical stress–deformation analyses, and may inform future development of constitutive models.},

	abstract = {Chemical and biological processes, such as dissolution in gypsiferous sands and biodegradation in waste refuse, result in mass or particle loss, which in turn lead to changes in solid and void phase volumes and grading. Data on phase volume and grading changes have been obtained from oedometric dissolution tests on sand–salt mixtures. Phase volume changes are defined by a (dissolution-induced) void volume change parameter (Λ). Grading changes are interpreted using grading entropy coordinates, which allow a grading curve to be depicted as a single data point and changes in grading as a vector quantity rather than a family of distribution curves. By combining Λ contours with pre- to post-dissolution grading entropy coordinate paths, an innovative interpretation of the volumetric consequences of particle loss is obtained. Paths associated with small soluble particles, the loss of which triggers relatively little settlement but large increase in void ratio, track parallel to the Λ contours. Paths associated with the loss of larger particles, which can destabilise the sand skeleton, tend to track across the Λ contours.},

	abstract = {Soil particles may be lost through dissolution, degradation or erosion. Regardless of the process of loss, there follows a change in soil structure both in terms of phase composition and grading. In this paper, the influence of size and amount of particle loss on phase composition at two stresses is investigated. The tests are performed on sand–salt mixtures, loaded in a modified permeation oedometer and subsequently dissolved. Changes in overall volume and void ratio are presented. Two significant observations about the volumetric consequences of particle loss can be made. First, overall volume changes are directly related to the amount of dissolved particles and to a lesser extent, the size of particle lost. Second, particle loss leads to an increase in void ratio; the magnitude of the increase is related to the amount of dissolved particles but appears not to be sensitive to either the size of particle lost or the pre-dissolution void ratio. Based on the observed response and a dissolution-induced void change parameter, the influence of different mechanisms of volume change is discussed. Tests were performed at two different vertical stresses with no discernible influence on void ratio change.},

DEM simulations and experiments using photoelasticity have shown that when an anisotropic stress condition is applied to a granular material, strong force chains or columns of contacting particles transmitting relatively large forces, form parallel to the major principal stress orientation. The combined effects of friction and the intermediate stress ratio upon the resistance of these strong force chains to collapse (buckling failure) are considered here using data from an extensive set of DEM simulations including triaxial and true triaxial compression tests. For all tests both μ and b affected the macro- and micro-scale response, however the mechanisms whereby the force chain stability was improved differ. While friction clearly enhances the inherent stability of the strong force chains, the intermediate stress ratio affects the contact density and distribution of orthogonal contacts that provide lateral support to the force chains.},

	title = {Quantifying the Evolution of Soil Fabric Under Different Stress Paths},
	abstract = {It is well recognized that the macro-scale response of soils is anisotropic in terms of strength, stiffness, permeability, etc. The source of this anisotropy is thought to be an anisotropy of the material itself. This anisotropy can be quantified using statistical methods if DEM numerical simulations or advanced experimental techniques are used. The anisotropic response of soil has been analyzed by many researchers in terms of the fabric tensor, which provides a measure of the orientation of the contacts between particles. Although many approaches for the quantification of the evolution of soil fabric have been used, they have not been previously compared to assess their effectiveness to describe fabric changes. A direct comparison of different methods of fabric quantification is presented in this paper based on the results from DEM simulations under different stress paths and the suitability of each of these methods is discussed. The results highlight the need for more accurate methods and/or approaches to accurately describe the evolution of fabric anisotropy in granular materials},

	title = {Specimen generation approaches for DEM simulations.},
	booktitle = {4th International Symposium on Deformation Characteristics of Geomaterials},
	abstract = {Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations ofelement tests cam provide significant insight into the micro-mechanics of soil response. It is well established that soil behaviour is strongly dependant on the initial density. Generation of particulate assemblies for three-dimensional DEM analyses must therefore allow for void ratio control. In this paper, different specimen generation approaches for DEM analyses are discussed. A methodology for the generation of assemblies of spherical particles with a specified initial density and stress state is presented. The effects of the different preparation methods on the specimen fabric are then considered in detail. For isotropic consolidation, it is shown that varying the coefficient of inter-particle friction allows control of the specimen void ratio at a specified confining stress. Simulations of anisotropic consolidation, from an initial isotropic stress state, to a final state where sigma(3) = K(0)sigma(1) indicated that the specimen void ratio and fabric are relatively insensitive to the intermediate stress path, provided an intermediate stress along the K(0) line was attained.},
