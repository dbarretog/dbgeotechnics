Architecture is frozen music. Architectural heritage is a crystallization of arts, engineering, culture and history, carrying the ancient wisdom of different 
nations, an indelible mark of human-nature interactions, and undoubtedly, a national treasure. This is more precious in the minority regions in China, such 
as Guangxi and Inner Mongolia due to their unique living style, source of livelihood, tortuous history and differentiated cultural integrations in the past. 
However, it has attracted less attention than those more developed regions in coastal line areas in China.

Architectural conservation is always one of the most important elements during the practice of architects and civil engineers. It is challenging but rewarding, 
and it is becoming more important and compelling under the current double pressure of economic development and the fast-growing demand for housing. The modern, 
yet less culture-rich concrete, steel dominant construction technologies are overshadowing traditional bio-/natural fibre-based construction in these minority 
regions.

In this project, through the trilateral international research collaboration, the project team aims to develop a unique research programme to integrate and 
re-engineer the architectural heritage in Guangxi, Inner Mongolia Minority regions in China with the UK modern bio-based construction technology.

This is a project led by my colleague [Prof. Johnson Zhang](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/johnson-zhang) and also in collaboration with 
[Dr Suha Jaradat](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/suha-jaradat) and [Dr Ahmed Mohamed](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/ahmed-mohamed).
