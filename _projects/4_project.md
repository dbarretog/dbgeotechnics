In this project we partnered with [Geo-Info Ltd](https://geo-info.co.uk/) via funding from the Scottish Funding Council. An Innovation Voucher was first used
to test the performance of optical fibre sensors for measuring soil displacement at laboratory scale. This was then followed by a subsequent Student Placement
Voucher for Daniel Hook (now at BEAR Scotland) assessed their perfomance in-situ.

Our in-situ tests were performed along various sections of the [Bo'ness & Kinneil Railway](https://www.bkrailway.co.uk/) (their support is appreciated). While 
movements induced by railway operations were easily detected, it was noted that the location of the sesnsors, as well as their installation was significantly
important for the successful detection of movements.
