This project was funded by Built Environment - Smarter Transformation, BE-ST, (formerly Construction Scotland Innovation Centre, CSIC) between June 2020 and
March 2021. It was led by my colleague [Dr John McDougall](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/john-mcdougall), whilst most of the work was performed by 
[Dr Juan Bernal-Sanchez](https://www.napier.ac.uk/people/juan-bernalsanchez). Additional collaborators included 
[Prof. Gabi Medero](https://researchportal.hw.ac.uk/en/persons/gabriela-m-medero) from Heriot Watt University, and Donald Cook (formerly at COWI).

The economic development and social resilience of communities in rural Scotland is being hampered by a shortage of affordable housing. Nationally, about 
23,000 new homes per year are needed, whilst in the year up to October 2018, only 18,000 were built (BBC, 2019). The remoter rural areas of Scotland are 
spacious enough to offer considerable scope for affordable housing development and generally have lower land values but other factors including challenging 
ground conditions, notably peat, can make development in these areas economically unviable and environmentally unsustainable.

Scottish peatlands are predominantly blanket bogs, the largest of which are found in the Highlands and Western Isles. Around 20% of Scotland’s land surface 
area is covered by blanket bogs alone, which in turn is about 15% of the global total for this habitat (Bruneau and Johnson, 2014). In response to the 
shortage of affordable housing and the incidence of peat soils, this project sought to:

- Identify the scale of the shortage,
- Recognise the significance of construction on the peat from a multidisciplinary standpoint,
- Compare, existing and innovative options for foundation design on peat, so as to lessen the magnitude of the construction challenge.
