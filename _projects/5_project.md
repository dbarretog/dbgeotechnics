As a result of funding by the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (Bilateral Exchange Programme) I was able to visit Hungarian
colleagues at Obuda University, Budapest University of Technology and Economics and University of Debrecen. During two three-month visits in Budapest we 
discussed and extended the use of the grading entropy concept to describe particle size distributions. We then anlaysed the results of DEM simulations and 
assessed the effect of the PSD on several geotechnical properties using both macro- and micro-mechanical approaches

Dr Emoke Imre is one of my closest academic collaborators and many outputs have been delivered across the years resulting from these exchanges 
(see Publications tab).
